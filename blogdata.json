Since it is also my first attempt to write a blog excuse me if I make a few errors. This site is actually hosted on GitHub. Let me give you a back story. So, in resent times I have been having second thought on my Job and I figured something needs to change. Over the years I have worked with Android, some Objective C, lot of sever side stuff, Some AWS and finally Core Java (This is my go to Language if I find myself in a tight spot), so anyways since I donâ€™t have a Facebook profile no one knows that I even exist :). So, I started this as a project to get some visibility if Someone searches my name or something on Google. I have quite a few stories to tell when it comes to my journey of working for a startup and I thought I could share it if I had a blog. However enough of this talk let me tell you how I got to a place where you can read this. So technically setting up a website is pretty easy these days all you need is a WordPress account select a theme do some random configurations and you are on. I didnâ€™t want that since one of my goals of this exercise was to figure out the basics and also at the cheapest I could. So, I chose GitHub as it lets users host static webpages and you donâ€™t have to shell out money for that. You may ask why I didnâ€™t choose AWS, well then again it was about making a basic website that talks about me as a person and getting an AWS ec2 Instance or using their static web hosting, I mean why. If I had to make money of this website sure. But I wanted the cheapest route. Free with no credit card entry seems like a fine choice for me. One problem though, how does one write blogs without a database. Found a few static blogging tools but it seems to me it could be a good project in itself. So, I decided to write this JugardBlog (Jugard means getting things done by any means possible in Hindi). What I chose for this is a static file with json content in it. When you are reading this all I am really doing is reading that JSON file and wrapping it up in some HTML. If you want to find out how I did it just inspect the code its easy copied code that reads a json file and renders the contents on the screen. To do that right click if you are using chrome and do Page Source and look for<br>  <b>â€œfunction myFunction(response)â€�</b><br>Maybe in the next blog I will write more about the technical backstory of this one.This is my Hello World Blog. If this makes no sense do drop me an email.\"",
